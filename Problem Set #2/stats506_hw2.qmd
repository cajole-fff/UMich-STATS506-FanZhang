## Problem 1 - Dice Game 

Let's play a dice game. It costs $2 to play. You roll a single 6-sided die.
* On a roll of 2, 4, or 6, you win the amount on the roll (e.g. a roll of 4 wins $4).
* On a roll of 1, 3, or 5, you lose.
We're going to implement this in different ways. Each function takes in as input the number of dice to roll, and each function returns your total winnings or loses. 

a. Implement various versions of this game. 

Version 1. Implement this game using a loop over the die rolls. 

```{r}
play_dice_loop <- function(num_die_rolls = 1){
    winnings <- 0
    for(i in 1:num_die_rolls){
        roll <- sample(1:6, 1)
        winnings <- winnings + (1 - 2 * (roll %% 2)) * roll
    }
    return(winnings)
}
```

Version 2.
