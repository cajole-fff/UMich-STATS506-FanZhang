## Problem 1 - Plotting 

Use the `nnmaps` data set again. I'd recommend using `ggplot2` for these, but you can do them in base R or `plotly` if you'd prefer.

a. Produce a graph of the `mean` monthly temperature in celsius. Draw a scatter-plot where the $x$-axis is month and the $y$-axis is the average monthly temperature in celsius. Add a line connecting the points within each season and color the lines and points by season (same color for lines and points in the same season)
